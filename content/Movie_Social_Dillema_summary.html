<div class='content'>
The Social Dilemma is a documentary film released in 2020 that explores the impact of social media on our lives. The film features interviews with former employees of major tech companies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, who discuss the design and impact of social media platforms.<br />
<br />
The film highlights the addictive nature of social media and how it is designed to keep users engaged for as long as possible. It also explores the negative effects of social media, such as the spread of misinformation, the erosion of privacy, and the impact on mental health.<br />
<br />
One of the key points made in the film is that social media algorithms are designed to create echo chambers, where users are only exposed to content that confirms their existing beliefs. This can lead to the polarisation of society and the spread of extreme views.<br />
<br />
The film also discusses the use of personal data by tech companies for targeted advertising. This has led to concerns over the use of this data by political campaigns, with fears that it could be used to manipulate elections.<br />
<br />
Overall, The Social Dilemma is a thought-provoking and timely documentary that raises important questions about the impact of social media on our lives. It highlights the need for greater regulation and ethical considerations in the design and use of these platforms.</div>
