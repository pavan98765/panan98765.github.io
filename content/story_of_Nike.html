<div class='content'>
Nike is one of the world's most renowned sports brand. It is an American multinational corporation that designs, develops, and sells athletic footwear, apparel, and accessories. The company was founded on January 25, 1964, by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight. <br />
<br />
The story of Nike began when Phil Knight, a track athlete at the University of Oregon, was looking for high-quality running shoes. He found that the Japanese brand Onitsuka Tiger was making some of the best shoes at the time. In 1963, Knight traveled to Japan to meet with the executives of Onitsuka Tiger and convinced them to allow him to distribute their shoes in the United States.<br />
<br />
Knight then teamed up with his former coach, Bill Bowerman, to start a company that would import and distribute Onitsuka Tiger shoes. They named the company Blue Ribbon Sports, and in 1964, they began selling shoes out of the trunk of Knight's car.<br />
<br />
The company's big break came in 1971, when Carolyn Davidson, a graphic design student at Portland State University, created the Nike "swoosh" logo for the company. The logo was meant to convey movement and speed, and it has since become one of the most recognized logos in the world.<br />
<br />
In 1978, Blue Ribbon Sports officially changed its name to Nike, Inc. The company continued to grow and expand its product line, introducing new shoes and apparel for various sports. In the 1980s, Nike became a cultural phenomenon, with its shoes and apparel being worn by athletes and non-athletes alike.<br />
<br />
Today, Nike is a global brand with a presence in more than 190 countries. The company is known for its innovative products, iconic branding, and commitment to sustainability. Nike has also been involved in various social and political issues, including supporting Colin Kaepernick and the Black Lives Matter movement.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, the story of Nike is a testament to the power of entrepreneurship, innovation, and branding. From humble beginnings as a distributor of imported shoes, Nike has become one of the most recognizable and respected brands in the world.</div>
