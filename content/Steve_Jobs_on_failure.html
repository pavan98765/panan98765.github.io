<h1> Steve Jobs on failure </h1><img src='cover_img.jpg' alt='Cover Image'>

Steve Jobs once famously said, "I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life."<br />
<br />
This quote from Jobs is a testament to his resilience and the power of failure. Failure is often seen as a negative thing, but in reality, it can be the catalyst for growth and success.<br />
<br />
Jobs was able to turn his dismissal from a company he co-founded into a positive experience by using it as an opportunity to reassess his priorities and start anew. He embraced the uncertainty of being a beginner and used it to fuel his creativity.<br />
<br />
In our own lives, we can learn from Jobs and the power of failure. Instead of letting failure defeat us, we can use it as a chance to learn and grow. By embracing failure as a natural part of the learning process, we can unlock our full potential and achieve even greater success.<br />
<br />
So the next time you experience failure, remember Steve Jobs' words and use it as an opportunity to start fresh and enter a more creative and fulfilling period of your life.</div>
